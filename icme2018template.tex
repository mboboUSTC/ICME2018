\begin{abstract}

Synaptic cleft is an importance area for neuroscientists to analyze the macromolecular complexes related to neurotransmission.
However, the large amount of noise and low signal-to-noise ratio in raw electron micrographs make it significantly challenging to extract this region automatically.
%
In this paper, we propose a simple but effective framework to automatically extract accurate boundaries of synaptic cleft regions. 
Our approach concatenates a contour growing step to a fully convolutional network (FCN), so that it takes the advantage of large receptive fields of FCNs to precisely localize the synaptic cleft region in a noisy image, and then precisely extract the region boundaries by a fine-level contour evolution technique. 
%
While considering both the texture and contours, our approach is more robust to noises, and outperforms all existing single-model FCNs on accurate segmentation in electron micrographs.

\comments{
In this paper, we proposed a novel contour extraction algorithm combined with a fully convolutional network to localize the accurate synaptic cleft region in such highly noisy images.
%
Starting with an initial segmentation form a fully convolutional network, our contour extraction algorithm first finds out an initial piece of contour from the pre-segmentation, and then grows it to localize the whole synaptic cleft region.
Different from previous region-based techniques or dense prediction networks, our model focuses on localizing the exact contours rather than the internal texture, which is more robust to noises in electron micrographs.
Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method on segmenting the target regions in electron micrographs.

\section{CONCLUSION}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we provide an effective method to segment the synaptic cleft region in challenging cryo-electron tomography data.
With the help of pre-segmenting by CNNs, our contour growing algorithm can accurately localize the whole contour of the synaptic cleft, which is more robust to noise and complex texture of target region.
Especially, a new updating strategy for contour evolving method is superior to traditional GVF, which can be extended to many tasks.
The experiments show that our framework is very effective in segmenting synaptic cleft, which is significant for biomedical analysis.
